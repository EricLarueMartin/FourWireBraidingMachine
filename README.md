# FourWireBraidingMachine
Four wire braiding machine constructed out of widely available or printed parts.

Uses four horn gears to move four spool holders around on carriages. 
Design files for inventor included. Design could easily be extended for larger number of wires.


In addition to printed parts the following will be needed:

NEMA 17 stepper motors and drivers (L298N stepper motor driver boards were used, but anything compatible with Arduino is fine)

Arduino (Arduino Leonardo was used, but any Arduino is fine)

608 bearings (standard roller skate or skateboard bearings)

M8 threaded rod

M8 lock nuts (jam nuts could also be used)

M3 partially threaded bolts (for spool shaft)

M3 flathead bolts (must be flathead for gears to pass over bolt)

M3 threaded rods

M3 lock nuts (jam nuts could also be used)

Spring for clutch, SP-9702 was used but anything that fits and isn't too strong should work.

Spring for tips, 152-B from W.B. Jones Spring Co was used. Many other springs were found to work, but this is less tolerant than the clutch as it can't be adjusted.

**Ultem parts for ultra clean braiding:**

For the spools that go around the track:

4x SpoolHolderGuide

4x SpoolHolderRiser

4x SpoolSinglePieceTraditionalMachining — this is a remake of Spool designed for traditional machining.

For the winder:

1x WinderBracketInsert

1x WinderSpoolSinglePieceTraditionalMachining — this is a remake of WinderSpool designed for traditional machining.

When using the braider with Ultem parts print WinderBracket without the insert. WinderBracket and WinderBracketInsert can be printed as a single piece if not using a clean insert.
