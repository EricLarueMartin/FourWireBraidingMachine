A non-twisting cable braider was designed for braiding the signal cables
 for the LEGEND experiment, which requires very low-noise signal transmission.
 The area between cables acts as an antenna, picking up noise proportional
 to the area enclosed by the cables from ambient electromagnetic radiation.
 Two methods of reducing pickup noise used by LEGEND are braiding cables
 and shielding cables.
 By braiding the cables alternating loops are formed, which will have alternatin
g polarity of pickup noise from loop to loop.
 This causes significant cancellation of pickup noise.
 Smaller loops formed by twisting the cable tighter tends to provide better
 noise reduction, and has the added benefit of producing an easier to handle
 cable bundle.
 Shielding the signal conductor with a grounded shield also reduces pickup
 noise, but there is always some noise that makes it through the shieldâ€”especial
ly at low frequency where the skin depth is longer than shield thickness.
 In bundles of shielded cables, the shields themselves also become antenna
 loops and this pickup can be mitigated by braiding the cables.
 LEGEND is testing braided bundles of individually shielded coaxial cables.

A spool assembly, half section view on the right.
 Cable is wound around the spool and the free end is threaded through the
 hole in the top of the spool holder.
 The spool rotates around a horizontal axle, this way no twisting of the
 cable occurs from unwinding the cable from the spool.
 The spring around the spool axle held by a bushing positioned by a lock
 nut applies force on the spool against the rising arm of the spool holder.
 Moving the lock nut adjusts the tension of the spool to prevent it from
 unwinding freely.
 An alternate design with a rewinder was considered to take up slack as
 the spool traveled through the central area of the track, but the slack
 didn't cause any issues so this simple friction clutch was used.

The LEGEND cable braider uses spools on carriages that are moved around
 a track by horn gears.
 As it is weaved the finished cable is wound on another spool, and the relative
 speed at which the cable is wound compared to how frequently the spool
 carriages move around the track controls the braid pitch.
 Cable braiders employing spools being moved around a track by horn gears
 have been used for more than a century.
 The most popular type is a maypole pattern, formed by two groups of cable
 carriers moving in opposite directions around a rough circle.
 The carriers switch between the inside and outside track to weave a tube
 around the center.
 Another method is to pass pairs of cables through the center of the cable
 braid, cycling through pairs of cables.
 Such a design was patented in 1989 under US patent 4803909.
 When braiding only four cables, such as will be done for LEGEND, this pattern
 is identical to a maypole braiding pattern.
 If additional spools are added to the LEGEND braider it will closely resemble
 the 1989 design, but with a key improvement to preventing twisting the
 cables.
 Braiding the LEGEND signal cables on a machine similar to the 1989 style
 of braiding machine resulted in either braids with too long a braid pitch
 to be easily handled, or kinks in the braided cable as shown in figure

Kinks occurred when tightly braiding the LEGEND signal cables using a braiding
 machine that would twist the cables.
 Two such kinks are circled in red.
 Also shown on the spool is a section of cable that was braided with a longer
 braid pitch.
 While the longer braid pitch prevented kinks, the cable was difficult to
 handle.

\begin_layout Standard
As the spools are moved around the track they rotate one revolution per
 trip around the track, twisting the cable once.
 This can be compensated for by taking the cable off the end results in
 one twist per loop removed from the spool.
 If the spools are wound such that the twist from cable coming off the spool
 cancels the twist from traversing the track there is no resulting twist
 in the cable.
 However, this requires the circumference of the spool matches the braid
 pitch.
 This would require a tightly wound spool for a tight cable braid, limiting
 the braid pitch by the minimum bending radius of the cable.
 This approach to eliminating cable twisting was unsuitable for attaining
 the high braid pitch desired for LEGEND.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To achieve a high braid pitch two improvements were made to the cable braider
 over the initial design.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most importantly, the spools were oriented so cable was taken from the side
 instead of the end, so that there was no twisting induced by unwinding
 the cable from the spool (see figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:spool-assembly"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 The track was redesigned to compensate for rotation of the spool as it
 traveled around the track (see figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Track"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 This counter rotation was induced by recesses added to the track.
 The recesses would catch the carriage guides and rotate the spools to compensat
e for the rotation due to movement around the track.
 Adding a retractable part of the track that the guide can push aside was
 found most effective, but rotation can be induced using a fixed track with
 only recesses.

The second improvement was to shift the position of the spool carriages
 on the horn gears.
 In the previous design the slots in the horn gears were symmetric, causing
 two spools to be in the same position on opposite sides of the track.
 The carriages experience some positions of higher resistance, the most
 noticeable for the non-twisting cable braider is when pushing on the retractabl
e track section.
 By shifting the spool positions (see figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Offset"
plural "false"

\end_inset

) the machine only has to push a spool carriage through these difficult
 points one at a time instead of two at a time, reducing the torque required
 by the motor and allowing the machine to run faster.
 Breaking the symmetry of the track would have accomplished this as well
 but would have been more complicated.

Additional slots were added to the horn gears to allow offsetting the spools,
 so no more than one spool at a time passed the same problem point in the
 track.
 Preventing two spools from passing the rotation compensating corners at
 the same time is most important, as that is the highest resistance point
 in the movement.
 The carriage guide portion of the spool assemblies are shown in gray.
