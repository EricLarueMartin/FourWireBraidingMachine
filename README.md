# FourWireBraidingMachine
Four wire braiding machine constructed out of widely available or printed parts.

Uses four horn gears to move four spool holders around on carriages. 
Design files for inventor included. Design could easily be extended for larger number of wires.


In addition to printed parts the following will be needed:

NEMA 17 stepper motors and drivers (L298N stepper motor driver boards were used, but anything compatible with Arduino is fine)

Arduino (Arduino Leonardo was used, but any Arduino is fine)

608 bearings (standard roller skate or skateboard bearings)

M8 threaded rod

M8 lock nuts (jam nuts could also be used)

M3 partially threaded bolts (for spool shaft)

M3 flathead bolts (must be flathead for gears to pass over bolt)

M3 threaded rods

M3 lock nuts (jam nuts could also be used)

Spring (for clutch, SP-9702 was used but anything that fits and isn't too strong should work)
